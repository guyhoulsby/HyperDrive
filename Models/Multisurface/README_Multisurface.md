The Multusurface folder contains example models implementing simple multi-dimensional models which can be given 
different dimensionality (ndim). Useful values of dimensionality are typically in the range 1-3. Models are implemented 
in the "series" form (_ser), "parallel" form (_par) and "nested" form (_nest).

Test files are included:
