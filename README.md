# HyperDrive
HyperDrive and associated code

HyperDrive is a Python 3.0 script that can be used to implement hyperplasticity models. It is under development, and upgraded versions will be released in future.

HyperDrive may be used for academic and research purposes but not for any commercial use. It is provided in good faith, but no guarantee whatsoever is provided as to its correctness, and the Author accepts no liability for its use.

Documentation of HyperDrive can be found in "HyperDrive documentation.pdf". Whilst I attempt to keep this up-to-date, sometimes it lags behind the code development.

HyperDrive used to require the additional files HyperCommands, HyperUtils and HyperCheck, but those are now all bundled into the single HyperDrive file. The new version also allows automatic differentiation using autograd.

A number of simple models are also now available on this site. The code for most of these may need some small changes to accommodate the latest version of HyperDrive.
